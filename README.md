# IMDB_Data-Analysis-using-Python
This project is based on the 100 top-rated movies from the past decade along with various pieces of information about the movie, its actors, and the voters who have rated these movies online. 

Key objective is to find some interesting insights into these movies and their voters and visualize them using Python 

**Data Reading and Inspection**

The data set has been successfully read and inspected. All three commands for data inspection (shape, info and null values) have been used.

**Data Analysis**

E*xploratory data analysis has been performed on the data set.* 

- Converted the budget and gross columns from dollars to millions.
- Profit column that contains the difference between gross and budget has been created, df sorted, top 10 movies extracted, outlier analysis done, negative profit movies extracted into a new df.
- Scale of metacritics changed, the average rating has been found,  universal acclaim data frame has been created.
- The names of the 5 most popular trios have been derived using appropriate code
- The number of trios satisfying the condition and the names of the top trio satisfying the condition has been correctly written.
- Runtime analysis has been done which primarily shows the length of the movie has been analysed using appropriate visualization.
- A data frame Popular and the order that matches the solution has been successfully created

**Demographic Analysis**

Combine the Dataframe by Genres

As a part of the sub task values had to be aggregated to the three columns in the data frame namely: genre_1, genre_2 and genre_3.

A bar chart for different genres vs. counts have been plotted to derive relevant insights.

The analysis for correlation between each gender and genre has been successfully made as all sub tasks have been properly completed.

The analysis was made for how US and non US voters responded to US vs non US movies.

The data frame genre_top10 has been sorted by CVotes1000 column, seaborn barplot has been used and right inferences have been drawn.
